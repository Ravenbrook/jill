<h2><a id="section-1" name="section-1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
This document describes the build process and documents the particular
procedure used in Jili.
</p>

<p>The readership of this document is anyone interested in the
project.</p>

<p>This document is client confidential.</p>

<h2><a id="section-2" name="section-2">2. Overview</a></h2>

<p>
The vast majority of the software for the core of Jili (disregarding the
build materials and the test materials for now) is in Java.
</p>

<p>
The build procedure is kept as simple as possible.  A certain amount of
complexity is required by the toolchains that are used for the JME
environments.
</p>

<p>
In terms of getting Java code running on a device it goes like this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Java source is compiled into <code>.class</code> files.
</li>

<li>
Compiled class files and 3rd party class files (for example, j2meunit if
building a test MIDlet) are assembled into their final positions in a package
hierarchy.  Other files are assembled into this hierarchy too.
</li>

<li>
At this stage an obfuscator could be run.  We currently don't do this.
</li>

<li>
A JME preverification tool is run (this annotates the class files so
that they can be securely loaded by the cut-down KVM used by JME).
</li>

<li>
A jar file is built.  In principle this jar file can be used by any JME
device, but that hasn't been tested.
</li>

<li>
The jar file is converted to a BlackBerry <code>.cod</code> file using a
tool from the BlackBerry SDK.  This <code>.cod</code> file is suitable
to loading onto a BlackBerry device.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Java binaries are not the only thing produced by the build process.
Javadoc documentation is compiled from the Java source using Sun's
javadoc tool.  A code style report (generated using Checkstyle) can also
be generated.
</p>

<p>
Most of the build procedure is captured in an Ant build file.  This file
also has procedures for running tests, and loading onto a real
BlackBerry device (neither of which are strictly, building).
</p>

<h2 id="section-3">3. Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
In general you need some way of building and running JME applications.
</p>

<li>
Java SDK.  Versions of 1.4.2, and 1.5.0_06 have been used.  The BlackBerry
JDE 4.1 claims to require Java SDK 1.5.
</li>

<li>
Ant.  Version 1.6.5 is used, but it should be possible to use older (and
newer?) versions as well.  The environment variable ANT_HOME should
be set.
</li>

<li>
A JME SDK.
On Mac OS X Mpowerplayer (mpp) has been used.  On Windows XP, the BlackBerry
SDK 4.1 has been used.  As long as you can build and run JME
applications then any SDK should be okay.  Currently the Ant build file,
<code>build.xml</code>, assumes it knows where the JME tools and class
files can be found.  If you place them somewhere else, you can set
<code>build.xml</code> straight by defining some properties in a
<code>buildprop.local</code> file.  See <a href="#section-4">section
4</a>.
</li>

<li>
Checkstyle.  Optional.
</li>

<li>
j2meunit.
</li>

<h2 id="section-4">4. Using Ant</h2>

<p>
This section isn't about how to use (and configure) Ant in general, it's
about how to use Ant in the Jili project.
</p>

<p>
As is standard, the command <code>ant -projecthelp</code> briefly
documents the public targets.  There are other targets, but they're
considered either internal (for example used to express internal
dependencies) or only of interest to staff hacking around in the build
file.
</p>

<p>
The build file is configurable with Ant properties.  Properties are
defined and used to specify the locations of 3rd party <code>.jar</code>
files and other things.  Any property defined in <code>build.xml</code>
can be overriden by creating a property in a file named
<code>buildprop.local</code>.  The <code>buildprop.local</code> file is
not supplied as part of the managed sources (it's not in source code
control), and Ant will not complain if it isn't present.  It's intended
to be created by any user that needs it (to override a property).
</p>

<p>
It is not currently possible to use <code>buildprop.local</code>, or any
similar feature, to define properties to have different values on
different platforms.  Thus, sharing a single build source tree across
different platforms, via NFS or Samba or similar, is not recommended.
</p>

<p>Here are the properties that you might want to change:</p>

<dl>

<dt>rim</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  Defaults to <code>C:/Program Files/Research In
  Motion/BlackBerry JDE 4.1.0</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
  This defines the location of the RIM BlackBerry JDE.  This is
  currently only intended to be used on Windows.
  </p>
  </dd>

<dt>mpp</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  Defaults to <code>/usr/local/mpp-sdk</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
  This defines the location of the mpowerplayer sdk.  This is currently
  only intended to be used on Mac OS X.
  </p>
  </dd>

<dt>j2meunit</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  Defaults to <code>lib/j2meunit.jar</code> (that is, a location within
  the project hierarchy).
  </p>

  <p>
  Specifies the location of the <code>j2meunit.jar</code> jar file from
  j2meunit.  For convenience this has been placed in the expected
  location under source code control.  You'll only need to fiddle with
  this if you have a perverse Perforce client map or you deliberately
  want to use a different version of j2meunit.
  </p>
  </dd>

<dt>checkstyle</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  Defaults to <code>lib/checkstyle-all-4.1.jar</code> (that is, a
  location within the project hierarchy).
  </p>

  <p>
  Specifies the location of the <code>.jar</code> file that defines the
  Checkstyle Ant task.  For your annoyance this hasn't been placed in
  the expected location under source code control.  You'll need to copy
  it here (the <code>.tar.gz</code> for Checkstyle can be found in
  <code>import/</code>.
  </p>
  </dd>
