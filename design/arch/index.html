<h2 id="section-1">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
This documents describe the design of Jill at a high level.
</p>

<p>
This is a draft docoument.
</p>

<p>
The readership of this document is anyone interested in the Jill
project.
</p>

<h2 id="section-2">2. Overview</h2>

<p>
A key design principle is to follow the PUC-Rio design closely.  This
reduces time spent making design choices and uses a design that is known
to work well for implementing Lua.
</p>

<p>
Because Jill must operate in constrained devices, designs that minimise
superfluous classes have been preferred.  This is in order to reduce the
size of any <code>.jar</code> file incorporating Jill.
</p>


<p>
The key modules are identified diagrammatically:
</p>

<img src="modules.png" border="1"></img>


<p>
The diagram is arranged so that generally modules make use of services,
and instantiate objects implemented by, modules lower down.
</p>

<p>
The extent to which these modules correspond to classes is yet to be
defined.  For example since Code (code generation) and Syntax (lexing
and parsing) are used as a single process when compiling it seems likely
that the functionality provided by these modules will be implemented in
the same Java class.
</p>

<p>
The modules are arranged in clusters:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Generation (of code)
</li>
<li>
Execution
</li>
<li>
Representation (of data)
</li>
<li>
Inspection (the oddball. debug module)
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Executable code is injected into the Jill system from two sources:
compilation from lua source and loading precompiled binaries.  Both of
these occur in the <code>Lua.load</code> method.  The Generation cluster is
responsible for these activities.  Generally the results of compilation
(or equivalently, undumping binary chunks) are a single function (one
per script) which generally will reference many constants, strings,
numbers, and other functions.  All of these objects are created using
the lower level Representation cluster.  The Syntax and Code modules
(the Java classes Syntax and FuncState mostly)
create code from Lua source, the Undump module (the Java class Loader)
creates code from a
compiled binary representation.  The compiled binary representation is
the same as the PUC-Rio implementation; this has the benefit that
binaries can be compiled offline (not on the target) and loaded on the
target, meaning that the compiler need not be working
in order to test the remaining parts of the system.
</p>

<p>
The Execution cluster is responsible for executing Lua code.  All Lua
code that is to be executed is in an internal binary form (clusters of
LuaFunction objects).  All execution begins by some Java code calling
the <code>call</code> method or the <code>resume</code> method (for coroutine resumption) of a Lua
state object.
Execution proceeds by the VM interpreting the VM
instructions of the function.  When control transfers to another Lua
function then the VM suspends its internal state in an internal stack
and begins interpreting VM instructions for the newly called function.
Note that the VM, under most circumstances, will not invoke itself to
execution a called Lua function, thus the Lua stack will not be modelled
by the Java stack; this is essential in order to implement coroutines.
Execution of VM instructions is suspended when Lua calls a function
implemented in Java (such functions are modelled as instances of the
<code>LuaJavaCallback</code> class);
when that function returns to the VM then the VM
will resume execution of VM instructions.  If the called Java function
requests a yield, which it will do with code similar to <code>return
L.yield(n)</code>, then the VM will remain suspended and return to its caller
(the Java code that originally invoked <code>Lua.call</code>).
</p>

<p>
Representation specifies how Lua values are modelled in terms of Java objects
and values.  Classes in this cluster will specify the layout, in terms
of Java objects, of Lua values and define the primitive operations on
these values.  This is a large part of the design and its details have
implications throughout the system.  See <a
href="#object-model">Object Model</a>, below.
</p>

<p>
The Debug cluster (module really) provides two services in Jill: the
interface to Lua's debug hooks (which is in reality likely to be a
method on the Lua state object); and, mapping of the compiled form of
Lua functions to source code (file, line number, variable name).
</p>


<h2 id="object-model">
3. Object Model
</h2>

<p>
An encapsulated Lua execution environment is represented by the class
<code>Lua</code>.
In order to minimise superfluous classes this class is likely to
implement a large number of methods.  This class will be the analogue of
PUC-Rio's <code>lua_State</code> object.  Like PUC-Rio's implementation
it is possible to have completely independent Lua execution
environments by creating multiple instances of <code>Lua</code>.  Also
like PUC-Rio's implementation Lua threads (aka coroutines) are
created from a main Lua instance and are Lua instances themselves.
</p>

<p>
Generally a value in Lua will be represented by an object (which
possibly references further internal implementation objects) in Java.
Java programmers using Jill will be able to store Lua values wherever
they like, they will not be restricted to storing them only within other
Lua objects (such as tables).  The JVM's GC will be used to implicitly
collect Lua objects.  This means that provision of weakness (the
<code>__mode</code> field of metatables, see <a href="#ref-lrm">LRM</a> <a
href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#weak-table">Weak
Tables</a>) and finalisation (the <code>__gc</code> field, see <a
href="#ref-lrm">LRM</a> <a
href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.10.1">Garbage-Collection
Metamethods</a>) are subject to
the implementation of equivalent facilities in the JVM.
</p>

<p>
A Lua value supports many generic operations.  These are represented
in Jill by methods on the Lua state object.
The following monadic operations are identified (whose
names are all taken from the equivalent functions from PUC-Rio's C API,
eg lua_call, lua_getfield, etc): call, getfenv, getfield, 
getmetatable, isboolean, isfunction, islightuserdata, isnil, isnumber,
isstring, istable, isthread, isuserdata, objlen, setfenv, setfield,
setmetatable, toboolean, tointeger, tonumber, topointer, tostring,
tothread, touserdata, type.
</p>

<p>
PUC-Rio's <code>lua_iscfunction</code> and <code>lua_tocfunction</code>
will have equivalents for Lua Java functions.
</p>

<p>
The following operations receive more than one value (operand):
concat, equal, lessthan, rawequal.
</p>

<h3>Representing Lua's nil, boolean, number, and string types</h3>

<p>
Lua's <code>nil</code> is represented by a single unique object,
<code>Lua.NIL</code> (this is created at class load time).
</p>

<p>
Lua's <code>boolean</code> is represented by Java's
<code>java.lang.Boolean</code>.  In particular each of <code>true</code>
and <code>false</code> is represented by the static object in Java,
<code>java.lang.Boolean.TRUE</code> and
<code>java.lang.Boolean.FALSE</code>.
</p>

<p>
Lua numbers are represented by Java's <code>java.lang.Double</code> class.
Generally there is no attempt to intern these; the number 1.0 may
be represented by several different instances of
<code>java.lang.Double</code>.
</p>

<p>
Lua strings are represented by Java's <code>java.lang.String</code> class.
</p>

<p>
The upshot of representing nil, boolean, strings, and numbers by their
"obvious" counterparts in Java is that we do not need to implement a new
class for each type.  This saves space in the <code>.jar</code> file, is
likely to be faster (less boxing and unboxing to perform), and is more
natural for Java programmers writing Jill extensions.  A
consequence is that the basic operations on Lua types (see above) cannot
be represented by instance methods since Java provides no way for us to
add an instance method to someone else's class, such as
<code>java.lang.String</code>.  That's why all the basic operations are
methods on the <code>Lua</code> class.
</p>

<p>
An alternative approach, where all Lua values were represented by an
(indirect) instance of a particular class, <code>LuaValue</code>, was
considered, but rejected because of the extra classes it would introduce
(bloating the <code>.jar</code> file)
and because it leads to less natural code for the Java programmer, who would
have to constantly create Java strings from Lua strings, convert Java
doubles to Lua numbers and so forth.
</p>

<p>
The VM Stack (see below) has a different representation for some Lua
values.  The stack is a <code>Slot[]</code>, an array of Slot objects.
Each element of the array refers to a Slot object.  Once a Slot object
has been assigned an element in the array the array element always
references that Slot object.  No Slot object is referenced by more than
one array element.  A Slot object is a pair and can contain either a
<code>double</code> value or a reference.  The slot objects are mutable.
When a VM instruction creates a new number value it writes it into the
double member of the target Slot object, thus no allocation need occur.
</p>


<h3>Representing Functions</h3>


<p>
A function implemented in Lua is represented by the class
<code>LuaFunction</code>.
A function implemented in Java is represented by (an instance of a
subclass of) the class <code>LuaJavaCallback</code>.  The embedder of
Lua will create Lua Java functions by subclassing
<code>LuaJavaCallback</code> and instantiating it.  The libraries that
are provided are all sublasses of <code>LuaJavaCallback</code>; the base
library is implemented in the <code>BaseLib</code> class, and so on.
</p>

<h4>
Functions implemented in Lua
</h4>

<p>
A function (closure) corresponds to some <em>code</em>, some closed over
variables (variables that are used in an inner function but are defined
in an outer function) which Lua calls <code>upvalues</code>, and an
<em>environment</em> (by default a function's environment is the same as
the environment of the function in which it is defined;
it is usually the global table, see
<a href="#ref-lrm">LRM</a> <a
href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#environ">2.9 -
Environments</a>).
</p>

<p>
The code is represented in the PUC-Rio source by a <code>Proto</code>
struct which is quite large; it contains a block of VM instructions, an
array of constants, an array of functions defined therein (actually an
array of pointers to <code>Proto</code> structs), the number of upvalues
used, the number of formal parameters, and some vararg information.
</p>

<p>
An upvalue is a reference to a variable defined in an enclosing
function.  They are represented internally in the PUC-Rio code by the
<code>UpVal</code> type.
PUC-Rio uses an optimised representation by which the value
is kept on the VM stack until the enclosing function returns.  In
returning, the enclosing function destroys its stack activation frame
and copies all stack values (that are about to be destroyed)
that are referred to by <code>UpVal</code>s into the <code>UpVal</code>
struct.  This operation is referred to as closing the upvalue; upvalues
that reference values that are still on the stack are <em>open</em>.
In PUC-Rio the enclosing function, that defines a variable that
is used by an inner function, has full-speed access to all its
variables; the inner function pays only a slight penalty (an extra
pointer indirection).  There is some housekeeping to do when a function
returns, but this is only necessary if its inner functions use upvalues.
</p>

<p>
(In PUC-Rio Lua) Upvalues are bound with a closure when the
<code>OP_CLOSURE</code> VM instruction is executed.  Each element in the
closure's <code>upvals</code> array is either a reference to an upvalue of
the enclosing function (that is, the variable in question in defined in
a function at least 2 levels "up" and is used by inner functions at
different levels) which has already been created, or is a reference to
an upvalue for a variable in the directly enclosing function (the
function being executed when the <code>OP_CLOSURE</code> instruction is
executed).  In the latter case the upvalue may already exist, if another
closure defined in this function needed it, or may need creating.  The
<code>luaF_findupval</code> does the job of searching for an
<code>UpVal</code> or creating one if necessary.
</p>

<p>
Keeping the same approach imposes the following design requirements on
Jill's upvalue mechanism:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Speed</dt>
<dd>Must not slow access to non-upvalue variables.</dd>

<dt>Housekeeping</dt>
<dd>For enclosing functions that have inner functions that use upvalues,
some extra housekeeping is acceptable when the enclosing function
returns.</dd>

<dt>Determine</dt>
<dd>Must be able to quickly determine if any housekeeping is necessary
when <code>OP_RET</code> is executed
(that is, whether there are any upvalues that need closing).

<dt>Close</dt>
<dd>Must be able to identify all upvalues that reference a stack frame
that is about to be destroyed (on function return).</dd>

<dt>Share</dt>
<dd>When a closure is created it must be possible to locate an upvalue
that has already been created for a particular stack slot.  This search
must be possible using the stack slot as the key.
</dd>

<dt>New</dt>
<dd>When a closure is created it must be possible to create new upvalues
that reference a particular stack slot (slots for which there is no
existing upvalue yet).</dd>

<dt>Enclosing</dt>
<dd>(easy) When a closure is create it must be possible to access the
upvalues of the enclosing function so that the closure can reference
them as well.  (This must be easy because the <code>OP_GETUPVAL</code>
instruction requires the same access)</dd>

</dl>

<p>
We take a similar approach to the PUC-Rio implementation.  An open
upvalue references the same Slot object that is referenced by the element
of the array used by the stack.  When the upvalue is closed a fresh Slot
object is created from the contents of the old one; this new Slot object
is then referenced by the UpVal and so is no longer shared with the
stack.
</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="upval.png" border="1">
<p>Illustration of <code>UpVal</code> representation when open and
closed (slightly wrong now).</p>
</div>

<p>
The set of open upvalues is accesssed in a near stack-like manner.
New upvalues are created by the <cod>OP_CLOSURE</code> opcode, and only
the currently active (topmost) function can create upvalues.  Whilst a
suspended function might have create some upvalues and might create some
more when execution returns to it, no upvalues that correspond to the
local variables of a suspended function will be created (until that
function becomes active again).  So the set of open upvalues consists of
all the upvalues created by one function, followed by all the upvalues
created by a function it called, followed by all the upvalues created by
a function it called, and so on.  The upvalues for the currently active
function can be created in any order.  All the upvalues for a function
(or block) are removed (by <code>OP_RET</code> or <code>OP_CLOSE</code>)
when the function returns.  Thus the access is near stack-like, new
upvalues are created within a set of upvalues confined to the current
function, and all the upvalues of a function are removed together (this
isn't quite true for upvalues inside loops and other <code>do ...
end</code> blocks, but it nearly is).
</p>

<p>
PUC-Rio uses a linked list to manage the set of open upvalues.  The list
is kept in order of stack slot position (top-most stack slot comes
earliest in the list).  In Jill
<code>java.util.Stack</code> could be a reasonable
choice. Examining the <code>Stack</code> class however,
we won't be using <code>pop</code>, as a single
<code>setSize</code> at the end of a close operation is likely to be
faster, and <code>search</code> is equally performed by
<code>lastIndexOf</code>.  The other methods of
<code>java.util.Stack</code> are worthless.  So we may as well use its
superclass <code>java.util.Vector</code>.
Of course we could, as in PUC-Rio, use a list-like structure but CLDC
has no list-like class so we would be forced to implement our own.
Tedious and pointless.  <code>java.util.Hashtable</code> is rejected
because it performs poorly for the <em>Close</em> requirement (it
would be O(n) time in the number of stack slots being destroyed as
opposed to the PUC-Rio implementation which is O(n) time in the number
of upvalues that require closing), and although it performs well for the
other requirements Jill will emphasise <em>Close</em> because PUC-Rio
does.
</p>

<h4>Functions implemented in Java</h4>

<p>
The code for functions that are implemented in Java, "Lua Java Functions",
is represented by an instance of the abstract class
<code>LuaJavaCallback</code>.  An abstract class
is preferred over an interface because method invocation is a shorter
JVM bytecode sequence.
</p>

<pre>
public abstract class LuaJavaCallback {
  abstract int luaFunction(Lua L);
}
</pre>

<p>
Generally we expect that the embedder of Lua will subclass
<code>LuaJavaCallback</code> and create an instance for each Lua Java
Function.  The implementation of a subclass's <code>luaFunction</code>
method will need to distinguish between its instances (each instance
represents a different Lua function such as <code>string.reverse</code>
or <code>string.match</code>).  There are several strategies for this:
extend the class with an instance member (an <code>int</code> say) that
will be different for each instance and can be used to determine which
function is intended; store each instance in a static member and use
these to compare against; make each instance be the sole instance of
a (possibly anonymous) subclass each of which implements
<code>luaFunction</code>, Java method invocation will invoke the
correct method.  Of these three the former (a discriminating instance
member) is preferred.  For JME environments the latter approach of
having a separate class for each instance (each Lua Java Function) is
not recommended as it will lead to <code>.jar</code> bloat.  The
libraries provided with Jill use the former approach; the instance
member is called "which".
</p>

<h3>Representing Tables</h3>

<p>
Lua Tables are represented by the class <code>LuaTable</code>,
which uses
the services of <code>java.util.Hashtable</code> (which thankfully
exists in
CLDC 1.0) to do some of the work.  
<code>LuaTable</code> is a subclass of <code>java.util.Hashtable</code>
(smaller and faster than alternatives).
The services beyond those provided
by <code>java.util.Hashtable are</code>: metatable, non-raw access (ie a getfield
which goes via the metatable if there is one), length (with non-obvious
semantics, see <a href="#ref-lrm">LRM</a>: <a
href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#len-op">The Length
Operator</a>), callable (metatable), concatable (metatable), comparable
(metatable).  All of these operations will be invoked by the Java
programmer using static method from the <code>Lua</code> class; recall
that this is necessary because in Lua all values support most operations.</p>

<p>
Because Intuwave have identified the array use of a table as important,
where the table is indexed mostly with keys that are integers from 1 to
N, the LuaTable class efficiently supports this case.  Like the PUC-Rio
implementation a table is split into two parts, an array part, and a
hash part.  In LuaTable the array part implements the table mapping for
all integer keys from 1 to <code>sizeArray</code> (an instance member)
inclusive.  The hash part is implemented by the superclass,
<code>java.util.Hashtable</code>.</p>

<p>The size of the array part can be
chosen when LuaTable is instantiated, using the <code>LuaTable(int,
int)</code> constructor, and is also determined automatically by the
implementation when a rehash occurs.  The VM instruction
<code>OP_NEWTABLE</code> will set the initial size of the array and hash
parts according to the hints specified by the compiler; this optimises
the case where a table is created in Lua using an initialiser: <code>t =
{1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c'}</code>.  When a rehash occurs
(<code>LuaTable.rehash</code> is invoked) a survey of suitable keys in
the table is taken and <code>sizeArray</code> is chosen to be the
largest power of 2 such that at least half the keys from 1 to
<code>sizeArray</code> are used.  This is basically a clone of the
PUC-Rio approach.
</p>

<p>Note that we are relying on the underlying table support providing by
<code>java.util.Hashtable</code>.  This may have different performance
from the PUC-Rio C implementation of hash tables.  For example, Lua's
<code>pairs</code> function from the base library will be implemented
using the <code>java.util.Enumeration</code> returned from the
<code>Hashtable</code>'s <code>keys</code> method, so this will be
reasonably efficient.  The <code>next</code> function, also in the base
library but less commonly used, is not supported efficiently by
<code>java.util.Hashtable</code> so its implementation in Jill will be
less efficient.
</p>

<p>
Also likely to have an impact on the performance of tables is the hash
function, which in Java is distributed amongst the classes whose objects
will be added to the table.  Since we are representing many Lua values
directly by corresponding Java objects, we will have no control over the
hash function (which for most of the types we will be using is in fact
specified by the Java platform.  EG <code>java.lang.String</code>).
</p>

<p>
The semantics of the Java <code>equals</code> method affects how objects
are keyed into a table.  If two Java objects are <code>.equals</code>
then they cannot both be added to a <code>Hashtable</code>.  This is a
concern when adding tables to tables.  In Lua each new table is a new
object and value, no two tables compare equal and when adding a table to
a table it will never clash with an existing key.  In JSE
<code>java.util.Hashtable</code> implements <code>equals</code> such
that tables are compared by the value of their contents when considering
equality.  Two <code>Hashtable</code>s are equal if the mappings they
implement are equal.  In JME (CLDC) <code>java.util.Hashtable</code>
does not implement <code>equals</code>, so inherits the most
discriminating <code>equals</code> method from <code>Object</code>.  The
upshot is that Jill's <code>LuaTable</code> class must implement
<code>equals</code> in JSE if it is to get the correct Lua table
semantics, but need not do this in JME.
</p>

<h3>Representing Userdata</h3>

<p>
In PUC-Rio Lua a userdata exists to create Lua values that reference
C types, either directly or via an additional pointer.  The
corresponding facility in Jill allows Lua values that reference
arbitrary Java objects and includes a per-object metatable.  It is a
simple class with a metatable member and an <code>Object</code> member.
</p>

<h3>Representing Coroutines</h3>

<p>
As in PUC-Rio Lua, Jill represents a thread (or coroutine) by a Lua
state object that shares a global environment with its parent coroutine.
Note that whilst coroutines share global environments they do not share
VM execution states so they represent independent threads of execution.
</p>

<p>
There is some state that is shared between threads that would ordinarily
best be implemented by each thread referencing a common object (or
objects), but in order to speed up access to the shared state from each
thread it is copied into each thread.  This is implemented in the
private constructor <code>Lua(Lua)</code> where the references to the
global table, the registry, and the one-off metatables are copied into
the new thread.
</p>

<h2 id="section-4">4. Execution</h2>

<p>The VM is responsible for executing Lua code after it has been
compiled into VM instructions.  The format is identical to the PUC-Rio
version of Lua:  Each instruction is a
32-bit quantity, which is represented by Java's 32-bit <code>int</code>
type.
</p>

<p>
The activities of the VM can be divided up as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Execution of straight line VM opcodes, for example
<code>OP_LOADK</code>.</li>
<li>Calling and returning from functions, both in Lua and Java.</li>
<li>Handling resume/yield for a coroutine.</li>
<li>Metamethods, which are generally called as a result of executing the
straight-line opcodes, for example <code>OP_ADD</code>.</li>
<li>Debug hooks (per line, per instruction, per call).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Within the execution of a single function the VM opcodes can access: the
"global" table (this is actually the environment table of the currently
active function), a number of constants (stored in the
<code>Proto</code> object of the currently active function), 
a fixed number of stack slots (locals and temporaries), a number of
upvalues (the upvalues accessible to a function are indexed via an array
stored in the <code>Proto</code> object for that function).
</p>

<p>
In order to optimise the operation of the numerical instructions (like
<code>OP_ADD</code>), which on the whole receive nnumbers as operands and
produce numbers as results, the stack is organised so that the VM can
execute such instructions without allocation.  The stack is a
<code>Slot[]</code>, each element of the array points to a unique
<code>Slot</code> instance.  The VM when it needs to write to a stack
slot mutates the <code>Slot</code> instance referred to by the array
element.  Each <code>Slot</code> instance can represent a double or a
Java reference.  Thus a new number, the result of <code>x + y</code> for
example, can be written into the target stack location without a new
object being allocated.
</p>

<p>
An upshot of the stack being a <code>Slot[]</code> is that numbers may
need converting from <code>double</code> to <code>Double</code> and back
again when crossing the API and also when being manipulated in tables.
A typical example is the <code>LuaTable.getlua(Slot, Slot)</code> method
which receives the key as a <code>Slot</code> and receives a
<code>Slot</code> to which the result is written.  The
<code>Slot.setObject</code> method is used to store the result; this
method is responsible for handling <code>Double</code> as a special
case.
</p>

<p>
The stack slots available to a function activation are fixed in number,
determined when the function is compiled.  The stack slots are arranged
in a stack: when a (Lua) function is called the actual arguments are
top-most stack slots of the calling function, and they become the
bottom-most stack slots of the called function.  The stack slots that
are available to a called function are the ones that are used for its
arguments followed by a fixed number of stack slots for its locals and
temporaries.  Each function activation gets a private set of stack slots
to work with.  The range of stack slots available to an activation is
typically denoted by (base, top), where <var>base</var> is the smallest
index available to the function, and <var>top</var> is one more than the
greatest index available to the function (this follows the analogous
pointer convention used in the PUC-Rio implementation).  In the source
code the instance member <code>stackSize</code> denotes the position of
<var>top</var>.
</p>

<p>
Thus when a function is called the following information needs to be
retained in order to restore the stack when the called function
eventually returns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The function (a reference to the function object for the suspended
function).</li>
<li>PC.  The next instruction to execute from the function's block of
instructions.</li>
<li>base and top stack index values.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This data forms the continuation when a function is called.
Note that much of the information that is used for VM execution, the
environment table, the upvalue array, the constant array, is retrievable
using just the function object, so that is all we need to store.
</p>

<p>
In order to avoid needless copying of arguments when a function is
called, the continuation data is stored in a separate stack of
<code>CallInfo</code> records.  The alternative, which is to store the
continuation on the regular VM stack would mean that when <code>f</code>
calls <code>g</code> the arguments would have to be copied from f's
stack frame to g's stack frame.
</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="stack.png" border="1" />
<p>Principal VM objects, for when Lua function f calls g.</p>
</div>

<p>
Note in the diagram that g's stack frame overlaps with f's stack frame.
When f calls g the arguments that f has pushed onto the stack become the
bottom-most elements of g's stack frame (a bit like sliding register
windows in some RISC CPU architectures).</p>

<p>
There is a small cheat in the diagram.  The <code>CallInfo</code> record
for the current function, the top-most record, is not completely filled
in during the execution of g; it's only filled in when g calls another
function.  So the diagram represents a point in the execution where g is
about to call another function, but no stack nor <code>CallInfo</code>
record has been allocation for the callee.
</p>

<h3 id="section-4.1">4.1 Coroutines and Yielding</h3>

<p>
Coroutines are represented by a separate <code>Lua</code> instance that
share some global state with its parent (global table, registry,
metamethods for string, nil, functions, etc).  Execution of coroutines
thus proceeds in a completely natural fashion, two coroutines provided
separate execution environments and do not interfere with each other.
</p>

<p>
Intuwave have an additional yielding requirement related to their
co-operative task implementation.  The requirement on Jill is that a Lua
Java function can yield the coroutine that called it by throwing an
<code>Exception</code>.  In such a circumstance Jill will catch the
exception, arrange the Lua state so that the coroutine is effectively
yielded (as if the Lua Java Function did a <code>return
L.yield(0)</code>), and then rethrow the exception (or behaviour
equivalent to this).
</p>

<h2 id="section-5">5. Errors</h2>

<p>
An error in a Lua program results in a transfer of control to the
invoking Java code (unless <code>pcall</code>, or similar, from the base
library has been used within Lua, but it uses the same mechanism).
</p>

<p>
The transfer of control is done using an <code>Exception</code> in Java.
A subclass of <code>Exception</code>, <code>LuaError</code>, is created
to store the extra Lua <code>errorStatus</code> values which needs to
get passed from the point where the error is generated to the catching
code (<code>pcall</code>).  In order to avoid littering the code with
<code>throws</code> declarations <code>LuaError</code> is a subclass of
<code>java.lang.RuntimeException</code>.
</p>

<p>
When an error is caught, the following VM state is restored by
<code>pcall</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>top-of-stack</li>
<li>base (virtual bottom of stack)</li>
<li>CallInfo stack</li>
<li>pc</li>
</ul>

<p>
Errors are also caught when a thread is executed using
<code>Lua.resume</code>.  In this case the VM stack is not unwound.
</p>

<h2>6. Compilation</h2>

<p>
The Jill compiler closely follows the PUC-Rio compiler.  This is
organised as a hand-coded lexer (not table-driven), and a hand-coded
recursive descent parser with table-driven operator-precedence parsing
for binary and unary expressions.  Code generation happens as the
program is parsed, thus there are very few explicit structures to
represent the syntax or the parse.  The representation of the parse is
implicit in the call-stack.  For example, as an expression is
parsed, code to evaluate that expression is generated (and emitted into
the code stream) and the compilation result is a register
(that is, the index of a VM runtime
register) which is available for enclosing expressions to make use of.
</p>

<p>
<code>BinOpr</code> and <code>UnOpr</code> in PUC-Rio are an enumeration
of binary and unary operators.  They are used for two purposes.  The
first is that they are used to communicate between the parser and the
code generator, as to which code needs to be generated.  The second is
that they are used in the operator precedence parser to index into a
table of precedence values.  In Jill these two enum types become
<code>int</code>.</p>

<p>
The operator priority table (for operator precedence
parsing) uses an anonymous two-element struct in PUC-Rio (for left- and
right- priority).  In Jill this is replaced with a 2-element array,
where <code>[0]</code> is the left-priority and <code>[1]</code> is the
right-priority.  Thus the table of priorities is an <code>int[][]</code>
(if Java were able to express such a thing it would be
<code>int[][2]</code>).
</p>

<p>
Code generation routines, in <code>lcode.c</code> in PUC-Rio, are
methods on the <code>FuncState</code> object.
</p>

<p>
Most of the lexical analysis and parsing routines are in the
<code>Syntax</code> class.  This class effectively replaces
<code>LexState</code> from the PUC-Rio implementation and implements
code that is in the PUC-Rio files "llex.c" and "lparser.c".
</p>

<p>
<code>expdesc</code> becomes the <code>Expdesc</code> class and is used
in quite an unconventional way for a Java class.  Its use follows the
way the <code>expdesc</code> struct is used.  A blank instance is
created at the beginning of an expression parse, and filled in as the
parse goes along (and sometimes modifed as well).
</p>

<p>
The low-level production of tokens differs slightly from the way PUC-Rio
does it.  <code>llex</code> (in both PUC-Rio and Jill) is responsible.
In the PUC-Rio implementation <code>llex</code> uses a pointer to return
the semantic information.  In Java it's not possible to use a pointer
directly, and the alternative of creating a class to hold the semantic
information wastes too much jar file size.  So in Jill <code>llex</code>
"returns" the semantic information by placing it in the instance
variables <var>semR</var> and <var>semS</var>.  The callers of
<code>llex</code>, <code>xLookahead</code> and <code>xNext</code>, then
copy the semantic information into <code>token*</code> or
<code>lookaheader*</code> as appropriate.  As there are only 2 different
callers, this approach seems fine.
