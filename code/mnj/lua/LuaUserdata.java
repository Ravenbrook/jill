/**
 * Models an arbitrary Java reference as a Lua value.
 * This class provides a facility that is equivalent to the userdata
 * facility provided by the PUC-Rio implementation.  It has two primary
 * uses: the first is when you wish to store an arbitrary Java reference
 * in a Lua table; the second is when you wish to create a new Lua type
 * by defining an opaque object with metamethods.  The former is
 * possible because a <code>LuaUserdata</code> can be stored in tables,
 * and passed to functions, just like any other Lua value.  The latter
 * is possible because each <code>LuaUserdata</code> supports a
 * metatable.
