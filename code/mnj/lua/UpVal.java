/**
 * Models an upvalue.  This class is internal to Jill and should not be

 * This is the analogue of the UpVal type in PUC-Rio's Lua
 * implementation, hence the name.
 * An UpVal instance is a reference to a variable.
 * When initially created generally the variable is kept on the VM
 * stack.  When the function that defines that variable returns, the
 * corresponding stack slots are destroyed.  In order that the UpVal
 * continues to reference the variable, it is closed (using the
 * <code>close</code> method).  Lua functions that reference, via an
 * upvalue, the same instance of the same variable, will share an
 * <code>UpVal</code> (somewhere in their <code>upval</code> array
 * member); hence they share updates to the variable.
