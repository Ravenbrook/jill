/**
 * Common superclass for all Lua Java Functions.  A Lua function that
 * is implemented in Java is called a Lua Java Function.  Each such
 * function corresponds to an indirect instance of this class.  If you
 * wish to implement your own Lua Java Function then you'll need to
 * subclass this class and have one instance for each function that you
 * need.  It is recommended that you extend the class with at least one
 * member so that you can distinguish the different instances.  Whilst
 * it is possible to implement each different Lua Java Function by
 * having a new subclass for each one, this is not recommended as it
 * will increase the size of the resulting <code>.jar</code> file by a
 * large amount.
